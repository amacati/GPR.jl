## config.json description

The GPs won't be able to predict reasonable dynamics without good initial hyperparameters. We ran experiments with several different configurations and
chose the set of hyperparameters for each experiment and dataset size that achieved the best test error.

In the config file, the parameters for each experiment are saved under a key named `<EXPERIMENTID>_<COORDS_TYPE><N_TRAINING_SAMPLES>` as an array.
The parameters of the maximal coordinate GP for a cartpole experiment with 32 samples for example are in `config["CP_MAX32"]`.

Experiment types are:
- P1 (Simple pendulum)
- P2 (Double pendulum)
- CP (Cartpole)
- FB (Fourbar)
